<h2><u>About web development</u></h2>
<p>A front-end dev takes care of layout, design and interactivity using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
    They take an idea from the drawing board and turn it into reality.

    What you see and what you use, such as the visual aspect of the website,
    the drop down menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end dev,
    who writes a series of programmes to bind and structure the elements, make them
    look good and add interactivity. These programmes are run through a browser.
    
    The backend developer engineers what is going on behind the scenes. 
    This is where the data is stored, and without this data, there would be no frontend.
    The backend of the web consists of the server that hosts the website, an application for 
    running it and a database to contain the data.
    
    The backend dev uses computer programmes to ensure that the server, the application 
    and the database run smoothly together. This type of dev need to analyse what a companyâ€™s 
    needs are and provide efficient programming solutions. To do all this amazing stuff they use a 
    variety of server-side languages, like PHP, Ruby, Python and Java.</p>
